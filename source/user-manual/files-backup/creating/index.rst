Creating a backup
=================

This guide explains how to create a backup of your Wazuh files, such as logs, and configurations. Backing up Wazuh files is useful when migrating your Wazuh installation to a different system. The :doc:`../restoring/index` documentation provides a guide that you can follow in restoring a backup of the Wazuh central components and Wazuh agent data.
