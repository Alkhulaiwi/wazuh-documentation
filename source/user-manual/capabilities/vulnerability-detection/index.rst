Vulnerability detection
=======================

Vulnerabilities are security flaws in computer systems that threat actors can exploit to gain unauthorized access to these systems. After exploitation, malware and threat actors may be able to perform remote code execution, exfiltrate data, and carry out other malicious activities. Therefore, organizations must have strategies or security solutions that promptly detect vulnerabilities in their network before bad actors exploit them. Prompt detection and remediation of vulnerabilities in a network help to strengthen its overall security posture.

The Wazuh Vulnerability Detector module helps users discover vulnerabilities in the operating system and applications installed on the monitored endpoints. The module functions using the Wazuh vulnerabilities database maintained by Wazuh. Wazuh aggregates vulnerability information into this database from external vulnerability databases indexed by Canonical, Debian, Red Hat, Arch Linux, Amazon Linux Advisories Security (ALAS), Microsoft, and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). It keeps this database updated ensuring the solution checks for the latest CVEs.
