Offline Update
==============

If the Wazuh server isn't directly connected to the Internet, it's still possible to keep the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) vulnerability information updated. You can fetch a database file from your local environment or network. To use the Vulnerability Detection module offline, follow these steps.

#. Download the Wazuh vulnerabilities file.
#. Edit the Wazuh server ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file. Add the file path in the vulnerability detection block. This configures the Wazuh server to locate it.
