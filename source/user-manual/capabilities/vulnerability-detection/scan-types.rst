   :description: Wazuh vulnerability detector has three different scan types. Learn more about it in this section of the documentation.

Scan types
==========

Wazuh has three different types of scans.

-  **Baseline**: The Vulnerability Detector triggers this scan type the first time you enable the module. The Vulnerability Detector performs a full scan of the operating system and every package installed. It creates a CVE inventory and generates an alert for each vulnerability.
-  **Full scan**: The Vulnerability Detector scans every installed package and operating system in this scan type. It runs only when the configured ``min_full_scan_interval`` expires and when the CVEs database contains new information. As a result, Wazuh generates alerts when there is any update/change in the vulnerability inventory.
-  **Partial scan**: The Vulnerability Detector only scans new packages. As a result, Wazuh generates alerts when there is any update/change in the CVE inventory.

A few considerations arise from this behavior:

-  The :ref:`min_full_scan_interval <vuln_det_min_full_scan_interval>` setting protects the manager performance by not running Full scans too often, especially when the manager receives many updates to the vulnerabilities feeds.
-  Every vulnerability in the agent vulnerabilities inventory is in three different states:

   -  **VALID**: Indicates that the vulnerability is still present in the system.
   -  **PENDING**: A Full scan is in progress, and the vulnerability needs to be confirmed.
   -  **OBSOLETE**: Indicates that the vulnerability is no longer present in the system. The Vulnerability Detector generates removal alerts when any vulnerability enters this state.
