Anomaly and malware detection
=============================

Anomaly detection refers to the action of finding patterns in the system that do not match the expected behavior. Once malware (e.g., a rootkit) is installed on a system, it modifies the system to hide itself from the user. Although malware uses a variety of techniques to accomplish this, Wazuh uses a broad spectrum approach to finding anomalous patterns that indicate possible intruders.

The main component responsible for this task is **rootcheck**. However, **Syscheck** also plays an important role.
