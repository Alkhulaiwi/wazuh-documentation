Custom Active Response
======================

A *custom active response* is a personalized script configured to be executed when a specific alert, alert level, or rule group is triggered. These custom responses can be created in any programming language and require a defined :ref:`command <reference_ossec_commands>` to initiate the script in response to a trigger and an :ref:`active response <reference_ossec_active_response>` configuration that determines when and where the command is going to be executed. Active responses can be stateless or stateful.

Stateless active responses
--------------------------

Stateless active responses have the simplest configuration of both types of ARs and are configured as one-time actions without an event to revert the original effect. The process entails passing the full alert to the AR via ``STDIN`` within a JSON object, and each AR is responsible for extracting the information necessary for its execution.

The JSON message format is as follows:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version":1,
        "origin":{
            "name":"worker01",
            "module":"wazuh-execd"
        },
        "command":"add/delete",
        "parameters":{
            "extra_args":[],
            "alert":{},
            "program":"program-name"
        }
    }


Wazuh allows you to program custom active responses in any language, but they need to be able to perform at least these actions for proper execution.

- Read ``STDIN`` to get the alert.

- Parse the read JSON object.

- Analyze the ``command`` field to check if it has to ``add`` the action or ``delete`` it.

- Extract the necessary information for its execution.

This is an example of the message with the full alert that is passed to the ``firewall-drop`` AR.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version":1,
        "origin":{

            },
            "program":"/var/ossec/active-response/bin/firewall-drop"
        }
    }

Stateful active responses
-------------------------

A stateful AR undoes its original action after the period of time specified in the active response. In other words, the stateful AR performs the basic actions of a stateless AR to later undo the process based on the command configuration. As part of the timeout behavior, when the received command is ``add``, the AR must execute this operation.

- Read ``STDIN`` to get the alert.

- Parse the read JSON object.

- Analyze the ``command`` field to check if it has to ``add`` the action or ``delete`` it.

- Extract the necessary information for its execution.

- Build a control message with the *keys* extracted from the alert in JSON format.

- Write ``STDOUT`` to send the control message.

- Wait for the response via ``STDIN``.

- Parse the read JSON object.

- Analyze the ``command`` field to check if it has to ``continue`` the execution or ``abort`` it.

.. note::

    The *keys* are those fields extracted from the alert that the AR script uses to execute its action. They must be sufficient to identify an execution instance, for example, to block a specific host, for which case the IP address is enough.

The control message format is as follows:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version":1,
        "origin":{
            "name":"program-name",
            "module":"active-response"
        },
        "command":"check_keys",
        "parameters":{
            "keys":["10.0.0.1"]
        }
    }

The response message is as follows:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "version":1,
    "origin":{
        "name":"node01",
        "module":"wazuh-execd"
    },
    "command":"continue/abort",
    "parameters":{}
  }

.. warning::

    When the ``STDIN`` reading occurs, it must be read up to the newline character (``\n``). In the same way, when writing to ``STDOUT``, the newline character must be added at the end. Otherwise, a deadlock may occur.

Customizing the behavior of an AR Python script
-----------------------------------------------

This section provides an example AR Python script, which can be used as a template to develop your own custom AR.

It is possible to customize the behavior of the script by modifying three sections:

- **Start/end custom key**: Select the necessary parameters to use from the alert. For example, select ``srcip`` to block the IP address or ``processname`` to stop the process.

- **Start/end custom action Add**: Execute the main action. For example, call the system function: ``pkill <processname>``.

- **Start/end custom action Delete**: Execute the secondary action, which is usually a recovery section after a time period. For example, wait a period of time to unblock an IP address after the main action has blocked it.


Stateless AR configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stateless ARs, as one-time actions, requires the following settings to be configured.

- Set custom key

- Set custom action *Add*

Stateful AR configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stateful ARs need the following configuration so they can undo the action after a specified period of time.

- Set custom key

- Set custom action *Add*

- Set custom action *Delete*

- Set timeout option in the ``active-response`` section of the ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file


Custom active response Linux example
------------------------------------

The following is a stateful AR in which the Python script creates a file containing the rule ID that triggered the AR. This AR is configured to delete the file after 60 seconds.

Configurable sections in this example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Start/end custom *key*: Rule ID taken from the alert.

    .. code-block:: Python

        alert = msg.alert["parameters"]["alert"]
        keys = [alert["rule"]["id"]]

- Start/end custom action *Add*: It creates the ``ar-test-result.txt`` file with this content: *Active response triggered by rule ID: <591>*.

    .. code-block:: Python

        with open("ar-test-result.txt", mode="a") as test_file:
            test_file.write("Active response triggered by rule ID: <" + str(keys) + ">\n")

- Start/end custom action *delete*: It deletes the file once the timeout is triggered. The timeout action must be set in the ``active-response`` section of the ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` configuration file.

    .. code-block:: Python

        os.remove("ar-test-result.txt")

- Manager ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file: This example configuration is triggered by rule ID 591, but it could be any other filter.

    .. code-block:: xml

        <command>
            <name>custom-ar</name>
            <executable>custom-ar.py</executable>
            <timeout_allowed>yes</timeout_allowed>
        </command>

        <active-response>
            <disabled>no</disabled>
            <command>custom-ar</command>
            <location>local</location>
            <rules_id>591</rules_id>
            <timeout>60</timeout>
        </active-response>

Custom active response Windows example
--------------------------------------

As Windows AR does not recognize Python scripts, these are two options to overcome this issue. The first option is to convert python scripts to executable applications, while the second entails running a Python script through a Batch launcher.

Convert Python scripts to executable application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Following this alternative, you use the PyInstaller tool to convert the Python script into executable files.

#. Install `PyInstaller from PyPI <https://www.pyinstaller.org/>`_.

#. Go to ``C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\active-response\bin\`` and run the following command to create the .exe.

    .. code-block:: doscon

        > pyinstaller -F custom-ar.py

#. Move the ``custom-ar.exe`` file to ``C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\active-response\bin\``.

#. Update the manager ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file with ``custom-ar.exe`` instead of ``custom-ar.py``.

    .. code-block:: xml

        <command>
            <name>custom-ar</name>
            <executable>custom-ar.exe</executable>
            <timeout_allowed>yes</timeout_allowed>
        </command>

With this setting, you are able to run an application instead of a Python script when triggering an active response on a Windows system.

Run a Python script through a Batch launcher
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this case, the AR script calls ``launcher.cmd`` which works as a bridge calling the ``custom-ar.py``.

#. Create a ``launcher.cmd`` file into ``C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\active-response\bin\`` with the following content:

    .. code-block:: batch

        @echo off

        setlocal enableDelayedExpansion

        set ARPATH="%programfiles(x86)%\ossec-agent\active-response\bin\\"

        if "%~1" equ "" (
            call :read

            set aux=!input:*"extra_args":[=!
            for /f "tokens=1 delims=]" %%a in ("!aux!") do (
                set aux=%%a
            )
            set script=!aux:~1,-1!

            if exist "!ARPATH!!script!" (
                set aux=!input:*"command":=!
                for /f "tokens=1 delims=," %%a in ("!aux!") do (
                    set aux=%%a
                )
                set command=!aux:~1,-1!

                echo !input! >alert.txt

                start /b cmd /c "%~f0" child !script! !command!

                if "!command!" equ "add" (
                    call :wait keys.txt
                    echo(!output!
                    del keys.txt

                    call :read
                    echo !input! >result.txt
                )
            )
            exit /b
        )

        set "name=%~1"
        goto !name!


        :child
        copy nul pipe1.txt >nul
        copy nul pipe2.txt >nul

        "%~f0" launcher %~3 <pipe1.txt >pipe2.txt | python !ARPATH!%~2 <pipe2.txt >pipe1.txt

        del pipe1.txt pipe2.txt
        exit /b


        :launcher
        call :wait alert.txt
        echo(!output!
        del alert.txt

        if "%~2" equ "add" (
            call :read
            echo !input! >keys.txt

            call :wait result.txt
            echo(!output!
            del result.txt
        )
        exit /b


        :read
        set input=
        for /f "delims=" %%a in ('python -c "import sys; print(sys.stdin.readline())"') do (
            set input=%%a
        )
        exit /b


        :wait
        if exist "%*" (
            for /f "delims=" %%a in (%*) do (
                set output=%%a
            )
        ) else (
            goto :wait
        )
        exit /b

#. Move the ``custom-ar.py`` file to ``C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\active-response\bin\``.

#. Update the manager ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` so the ``launcher.cmd`` can look for the name of the Python script to run in the option ``extra_args``.
