Cluster nodes configuration
---------------------------

The Wazuh cluster is made up of manager type nodes. Only one of them will take the master role, the others will take the worker role. For both node types, the configuration file ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` contains the cluster configuration values. Within the labels ``<cluster>...</cluster>`` the following configuration values can be set:

-  :ref:`name <cluster_name>`: Name that will be assigned to the cluster
-  :ref:`node_name <cluster_node_name>`: Name of the current node
-  :ref:`key <cluster_key>`: The key must be 32 characters long and should be the same for all of the cluster nodes. You may use the following command to generate a random one:

      .. code-block:: console

         # openssl rand -hex 16

- :ref:`node_type <cluster_node_type>`: Set the node type (master/worker)
- :ref:`port <cluster_port>`: Destination port for cluster communication
- :ref:`bind_addr <cluster_bind_addr>`: IP address where this node is listening to (0.0.0.0 any IP)
- :ref:`nodes <cluster_nodes>`: The address of the **master** , it must be specified in all nodes (including the master itself). The address can be either an IP or a DNS.
- :ref:`hidden <cluster_hidden>`: Toggles whether or not to show information about the cluster that generated an alert.
- :ref:`disabled <cluster_disabled>`: Indicates whether the node will be enabled or not in the cluster.

We are going to configure a cluster with a master node and a single worker node, for the **master node** we set the following configuration:

.. code-block:: xml

   <cluster>
       <name>wazuh</name>
       <node_name>master-node</node_name>
       <key>c98b62a9b6169ac5f67dae55ae4a9088</key>
       <node_type>master</node_type>
       <port>1516</port>
       <bind_addr>0.0.0.0</bind_addr>
       <nodes>
           <node>master</node>
       </nodes>
       <hidden>no</hidden>
       <disabled>no</disabled>
   </cluster>

Restart the master node:

.. code-block:: console

   # systemctl restart wazuh-manager

Now it's time to configure the **worker node**:

.. code-block:: xml

   <cluster>
       <name>wazuh</name>
       <node_name>worker01-node</node_name>
       <key>c98b62a9b6169ac5f67dae55ae4a9088</key>
       <node_type>worker</node_type>
       <port>1516</port>
       <bind_addr>0.0.0.0</bind_addr>
       <nodes>
           <node>master</node>
       </nodes>
       <hidden>no</hidden>
       <disabled>no</disabled>
   </cluster>

Restart the worker node:

.. code-block:: console

   # systemctl restart wazuh-manager

Let's execute the following command (works on both worker and master nodes) to check that everything worked as expected:

.. code-block:: console

   # /var/ossec/bin/cluster_control -l

.. code-block:: none
   :class: output

   NAME           TYPE    VERSION  ADDRESS
   master-node    master  |WAZUH_CURRENT|   wazuh-master
   worker01-node  worker  |WAZUH_CURRENT|   172.22.0.3

Forwarder installation
----------------------

-  The apps must be configured to point to the master's API.
-  All manager nodes need an event forwarder in order to send data to Elasticsearch or Splunk. Install **Filebeat** if you're using the **Elastic Stack** or **Splunk forwarder** if you're using **Splunk**. This is only necessary if the node is in a separate instance from Elasticsearch or Splunk.

.. _deploy_wazuh_agents_cluster:

Pointing agents to the cluster nodes
------------------------------------

Finally, the configuration of the agents has to be modified in order to report to the cluster. In this case, agent 001 will report to the worker01-node node. To achieve this, we must modify the information contained in the labels ``<client><server>`` in the file ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf``, where we will place the IP address of the node we want to report to, in our case, it would look like this:

.. code-block:: xml

   <client>
       <server>
           <address>WORKER01_NODE_IP</address>
           ...
       </server>
   </client>

Restart the agent:

.. code-block:: console

   # systemctl restart wazuh-agent

The second agent will report to the master-node node. For this, we will place the IP address of our master in the agent configuration, as we have seen in the previous case:

.. code-block:: xml

   <client>
       <server>
           <address>MASTER_NODE_IP</address>
           ...
       </server>
   </client>

Restart the agent:

.. code-block:: console

   # systemctl restart wazuh-agent


Execute the following command on the ``master node`` to verify that the Wazuh agents are correctly connected:

.. code-block:: console

   # /var/ossec/bin/agent_control -l

.. code-block:: none
   :class: output

   Wazuh agent_control. List of available agents:
       ID: 000, Name: agent000 (server), IP: 127.0.0.1, Active/Local
       ID: 001, Name: agent001, IP: 172.18.0.5, Active
       ID: 002, Name: agent002, IP: 172.18.0.6, Active

.. note::

   We recommend using a :ref:`load balancer <load_balancer>` for registering and connecting the agents. This way, the agents will be able to be registered and report to the nodes in a distributed way, and it will be the load balancer who assigns which worker they will report to. Using this option we can better distribute the load, and in case of a fall in some worker node, its agents will **reconnect** to another one.

Adding new Wazuh server nodes
-----------------------------

The Wazuh server collects and analyzes security-related events, performs log analysis, and provides real-time threat detection, incident response, and compliance management capabilities.

By adding a new node to a Wazuh server cluster, you can distribute the workload and improve the scalability and resilience of your security monitoring infrastructure. It allows for better handling of a larger number of agents and provides redundancy in case of node failures.

The upscale process involves creating certificates necessary for installation, followed by configuring existing components to establish connections with the new Wazuh server node(s). Then installing and configuring the new Wazuh server node(s), and finally testing the cluster to ensure the new nodes have joined.

We have organized the steps for upscaling the Wazuh server into two subsections: one for an all-in-one deployment and the other for a distributed deployment. Your choice between these methods depends on your existing deployment and the infrastructure you aim to upscale.

-  **All-in-one deployment**:

   If you have Wazuh all-in-one configuration, follow the steps outlined in the "All-in-one deployment" subsections to upscale your Wazuh server.

-  **Distributed deployment**:

   For an existing distributed deployment, refer to the "Distributed deployment" subsections to upscale your Wazuh server.

Ensure you select the appropriate sub-section based on your existing deployment. If you are unsure which method aligns with your infrastructure, consider reviewing your deployment architecture before proceeding.

.. note::
   
   You need root user privileges to execute the commands below.

Certificates creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Perform the following steps on your existing Wazuh server node to generate the certificates required for secure communication among the Wazuh central components.

All-in-one deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend creating entirely new certificates for your Wazuh server nodes. Perform the following steps to create new certificates.

#. Create a  ``config.yml`` file in the ``/root`` directory to add the new Wazuh server node(s):

   .. code-block:: console

      # touch /root/config.yml

   Edit the ``/root/config.yml`` file with its content as follows:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      nodes:
        # Wazuh indexer nodes
        indexer:
          - name: <WAZUH_INDEXER_NODE_NAME>
            ip: <WAZUH_INDEXER_IP>

        # Wazuh server nodes
        server:
          - name: <EXISTING_WAZUH_SERVER_NODE_NAME>
            ip: <EXISTING_WAZUH_SERVER_IP>
            node_type: master
          - name: <NEW_WAZUH_SERVER_NODE_NAME>
            ip: <NEW_WAZUH_SERVER_IP>
            node_type: worker

        # Wazuh dashboard nodes
        dashboard:
          - name: <WAZUH_DASHBOARD_NODE_NAME>
            ip: <WAZUH_DASHBOARD_IP>

   Replace the node names and IP values with your new node names and IP addresses.

   You can assign a different ``node_type`` in your installation. In this documentation, we assign the master role to the existing node and the worker role to the new node.

#. Download and run ``Wazuh-certs-tool.sh`` to create the certificates for the new node and recreate for the existing one:

   .. code-block:: console

      # curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-certs-tool.sh
      # bash wazuh-certs-tool.sh -A

#. Compress the certificates folder and copy it to the new Wazuh server node(s). You can make use of the ``scp`` utility to securely copy the compressed file:

   .. code-block:: console

      # tar -cvf ./wazuh-certificates.tar -C ./wazuh-certificates/ .
      # scp wazuh-certificates.tar <TARGET_USERNAME>@<TARGET_IP>:

This will copy the certificates to the home directory of the logged in user on the target system. You can change this to specify a path to your installation directory.

Distributed deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend you utilize pre-existing root-ca keys to generate certificates for new nodes. Perform the steps below on your existing Wazuh server node to generate the certificates.

#. Create a ``config.yml`` file in the ``/root`` directory to add the new Wazuh server node(s):

   .. code-block:: console

      # touch /root/config.yml

   Edit the ``/root/config.yml`` file to include the node name and IP of the new node:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      nodes:
        # Wazuh server nodes
        server:
          - name: <EXISTING_WAZUH_SERVER_NODE_NAME>
            ip: <EXISTING_WAZUH_SERVER_IP>
            node_type: master
          - name: <NEW_WAZUH_SERVER_NODE_NAME>
            ip: <NEW_WAZUH_SERVER_IP>
            node_type: worker

   Replace the values with your node names and their corresponding IP addresses.

#. Extract the ``wazuh-certificates.tar`` file.

   .. code-block:: console

      # mkdir wazuh-install-files && tar -xf ./wazuh-certificates.tar -C wazuh-install-files

#. Download and run ``./wazuh-certs-tool.sh`` to create the certificates for the new Wazuh server node using the pre-existing root-ca keys:

   .. code-block:: console

      # curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-certs-tool.sh
      # bash wazuh-certs-tool.sh -A wazuh-install-files/root-ca.pem wazuh-install-files/root-ca.key

#. Copy the newly created certificates to the ``wazuh-install-files`` folder making sure not to replace the admin certificates:

   .. code-block:: console

      # cp wazuh-certificates/<NEW_WAZUH_SERVER_NODE_NAME>* wazuh-install-files
      # cp wazuh-certificates/<EXISTING_WAZUH_SERVER_NODE_NAME>* wazuh-install-files

   .. note::

      If the pre-existing root-ca keys have been deleted or if for some reason you are not able to access them, you can proceed to create new certificates for all the nodes as follows:

      #. Create the ``/root/config.yml`` file to reference all your nodes

         .. code-block:: yaml

            nodes:
              # Wazuh indexer nodes
              indexer:
                - name: <WAZUH_INDEXER_NODE_NAME>
                  ip: <WAZUH_INDEXER_IP>

              # Wazuh server nodes
              server:
                - name: <EXISTING_WAZUH_SERVER_NODE_NAME>
                  ip: <EXISTING_WAZUH_SERVER_IP>
                  node_type: master
                - name: <NEW_WAZUH_SERVER_NODE_NAME>
                  ip: <NEW_WAZUH_SERVER_IP>
                  node_type: worker

              # Wazuh dashboard nodes
              dashboard:
                - name: <WAZUH_DASHBOARD_NODE_NAME>
                  ip: <WAZUH_DASHBOARD_IP>

      #. Execute the ``wazuh-certs-tool.sh`` script to create the certificates

         .. code-block:: console

            # curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-certs-tool.sh
            # bash wazuh-certs-tool.sh -A

      #. Compress the certificates folder and copy it to the new Wazuh indexer node(s). You can make use of the ``scp`` utility to securely copy the compressed file:

         .. code-block:: console

            # tar -cvf ./wazuh-certificates.tar -C ./wazuh-certificates/ .
            # scp wazuh-certificates.tar <TARGET_USERNAME>@<TARGET_IP>:

         This will copy the certificates to the home directory of the logged in user on the target system. You can change this to specify a path to your installation directory.

#. Compress the certificates folder into a new ``wazuh-certificates.tar`` file and copy it to the new Wazuh server node(s). You can make use of the ``scp`` utility to securely copy the compressed file as follows:

   .. code-block:: console

      # tar -cvf ./wazuh-certificates.tar -C ./wazuh-install-files/ .
      # scp wazuh-certificates.tar <TARGET_USERNAME>@<TARGET_IP>:

   This will copy the certificates to the home directory of the logged in user on the target system. You can change this to specify a path to your installation directory.

Configuring existing components to connect with the new node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All-in-one deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Create a file, ``env_variables.sh``, in the ``/root`` directory of the existing node where you define your environmental variables as follows:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export NODE_NAME1=<WAZUH_INDEXER_NODE_NAME>
      export NODE_NAME2=<EXISTING_WAZUH_SERVER_NODE_NAME>
      export NODE_NAME3=<WAZUH_DASHBOARD_NODE_NAME> 

   Replace ``<WAZUH_INDEXER_NODE_NAME>``, ``<EXISTING_WAZUH_SERVER_NODE_NAME>``, ``<WAZUH_DASHBOARD_NODE_NAME>`` with the names of the Wazuh indexer, Wazuh server and Wazuh dashboard nodes respectively as defined in ``/root/config.yml``.

#. Create a ``deploy-certificates.sh`` script in the ``/root`` directory and paste the following to it:

   .. code-block:: bash

      #!/bin/bash

      # Source the environmental variables from the external file
      source ~/env_variables.sh

      rm -rf /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs
      mkdir /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs
      tar -xf ./wazuh-certificates.tar -C /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/ ./$NODE_NAME1.pem ./$NODE_NAME1-key.pem ./admin.pem ./admin-key.pem ./root-ca.pem
      mv -n /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/$NODE_NAME1.pem /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/wazuh-indexer.pem
      mv -n /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/$NODE_NAME1-key.pem /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/wazuh-indexer-key.pem
      chmod 500 /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs
      chmod 400 /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/*
      chown -R wazuh-indexer:wazuh-indexer /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs

      rm -rf /etc/filebeat/certs
      mkdir /etc/filebeat/certs
      tar -xf ./wazuh-certificates.tar -C /etc/filebeat/certs/ ./$NODE_NAME2.pem ./$NODE_NAME2-key.pem ./root-ca.pem
      mv -n /etc/filebeat/certs/$NODE_NAME2.pem /etc/filebeat/certs/wazuh-server.pem
      mv -n /etc/filebeat/certs/$NODE_NAME2-key.pem /etc/filebeat/certs/wazuh-server-key.pem
      chmod 500 /etc/filebeat/certs
      chmod 400 /etc/filebeat/certs/*
      chown -R root:root /etc/filebeat/certs

      rm -rf /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs
      mkdir /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs
      tar -xf ./wazuh-certificates.tar -C /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/ ./$NODE_NAME3.pem ./$NODE_NAME3-key.pem ./root-ca.pem
      mv -n /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/$NODE_NAME3.pem /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/wazuh-dashboard.pem
      mv -n /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/$NODE_NAME3-key.pem /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/wazuh-dashboard-key.pem
      chmod 500 /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs
      chmod 400 /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/*
      chown -R wazuh-dashboard:wazuh-dashboard /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs

#. Deploy the certificates by executing the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      # bash /root/deploy-certificates.sh

   This deploys the SSL certificates to encrypt communications between the Wazuh central components.

   **Recommended action**: If no other Wazuh components are going to be installed on this node, remove the ``wazuh-certificates.tar`` file by running the command below to increase security. Alternatively, save a copy offline for potential future use and scalability:

      .. code-block:: console

         # rm -rf ./wazuh-certificates
         # rm -f ./wazuh-certificates.tar

#. Edit the Wazuh indexer configuration file at ``/etc/wazuh-indexer/opensearch.yml`` to specify the indexerâ€™s IP address as mentioned in ``/root/config.yml`` file:

   .. code-block:: yaml
      :emphasize-lines: 1,2,4

      network.host: "<WAZUH_INDEXER_IP>"
      node.name: "<WAZUH_INDEXER_NODE_NAME>"
      cluster.initial_master_nodes:
      - "<WAZUH_INDEXER_NODE_NAME>"

#. Edit the Filebeat configuration file ``/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`` to specify the indexerâ€™s IP address:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      output.elasticsearchhosts:
              - <WAZUH_INDEXER_IP>:9200

   .. note::
      
      The structure of this section will vary based on whether you completed your installation using the Quickstart script or the step-by-step guide. Here we used the quickstart script.

#. Generate an encryption key that will be used to encrypt communication between the cluster nodes:

   .. code-block:: console

      # openssl rand -hex 16

   Save the output of the above command as it will be used later to configure cluster mode on both Wazuh server nodes.

#. Edit the configuration file ``/etc/wazuh-dashboard/opensearch_dashboards.yml`` to include connection details for the indexer node:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      opensearch.hosts: https://<WAZUH_INDEXER_IP>:9200

#. Edit the ``/usr/share/wazuh-dashboard/data/wazuh/config/wazuh.yml`` file and replace the ``url`` value with the IP address or hostname of the Wazuh server master node:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      hosts:
        - default:
            url: https://<EXISTING_WAZUH_SERVER_IP>
            port: 55000
            username: wazuh-wui
            password: <WAZUH-WUI-PASSWORD>
            run_as: false

#. Edit the Wazuh server configuration file at ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` to enable cluster mode:

   .. code-block:: xml
      :emphasize-lines: 3-5,9,12

      <cluster>
        <name>wazuh</name>
        <node_name><EXISTING_WAZUH_SERVER_NODE_NAME></node_name>
        <node_type>master</node_type>
        <key><ENCRYPTION-KEY></key>
        <port>1516</port>
        <bind_addr>0.0.0.0</bind_addr>
        <nodes>
            <node><MASTER_NODE_IP></node>
        </nodes>
        <hidden>no</hidden>
        <disabled>no</disabled>
      </cluster>

   The configurable fields in the above section of the ``ossec.conf`` file are as follows:

..
   -  :ref:`name <cluster-name>` indicates the name of the cluster.
   -  :ref:`node_name <>` indicates the name of the current node. Replace ``<EXISTING_WAZUH_SERVER_NODE_NAME>`` with name as specified in the ``/root/config.yml`` file.
   -  :ref:`node_type <>` specifies the role of the node. It has to be set to ``master``.
   -  :ref:`key <>` represents a key used to encrypt communication between cluster nodes. It should be the same on all the server nodes. To generate a unique key you can use the command ``openssl rand -hex 16``.
   -  :ref:`port <>` indicates the destination port for cluster communication. Leave the default as ``1516``
   -  :ref:`bind_addr <>` is the network IP to which the node is bound to listen for incoming requests (0.0.0.0 means the node will use any IP).
   -  :ref:`nodes <>` is the address of the master node and can be either an IP or a DNS hostname. This parameter must be specified in all nodes, including the master itself. Replace ``<MASTER_NODE_IP>`` with the IP address of your master node.
   -  :ref:`hidden <>` shows or hides the cluster information in the generated alerts.
   -  :ref:`disabled <>` indicates whether the node is enabled or disabled in the cluster. This option must be set to no.
