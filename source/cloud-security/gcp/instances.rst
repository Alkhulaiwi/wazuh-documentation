Monitoring Google Cloud instances
=================================

You can install the Wazuh agent directly on Google Cloud virtual machines or instances for Linux, Windows, and macOS operating systems. Once installed, Wazuh agents collect security data from the monitored endpoints and transmit it to the Wazuh server for analysis. Security protection is applied to the monitored endpoints based on the analysis and the detected events.

Check the :doc:`Wazuh agent installation </installation-guide/wazuh-agent/index>` and :doc:`enrollment </user-manual/agent-enrollment/index>` documentation to learn more about the Wazuh agents. Additionally, read about Wazuh SIEM and XDR capabilities and their configuration in our :doc:`capabilities </user-manual/capabilities/index>` documentation.
