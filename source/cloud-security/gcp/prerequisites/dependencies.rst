  :description: The Wazuh GCP module allows you to fetch logs from Google Pub/Sub and Google Storage. Learn more about installing the required dependencies in this section.

Installing dependencies
=======================

.. note::
  The GCP module can be configured in both the Wazuh manager and the agent. The choice merely depends on where you want to reach the GCP services from.

Python
------

The GCP module requires `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/>`__. Specifically, it's compatible with
`Python |PYTHON_CLOUD_CONTAINERS_MIN|â€“|PYTHON_CLOUD_CONTAINERS_MAX| <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. While later Python versions should work as well, we can't assure they are compatible.

Google Cloud client library for Python
--------------------------------------

.. warning::

   The Wazuh manager includes all dependencies installed. These steps are only necessary when configuring the integration in a Wazuh agent.

`google-cloud-pubsub <https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-pubsub/>`_ is the official python library supported by Google to manage Google Cloud Pub/Sub resources. It is used to pull the log messages from the Pub/Sub queue.

To install the dependencies, execute the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   # pip3 install google-cloud-core==1.7.1 google-cloud-pubsub==2.7.1 google-cloud-storage==1.39.0 pytz==2020.1 setuptools==68.0.0
