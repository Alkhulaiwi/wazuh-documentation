Configuring the supported services
==================================

You can use the Wazuh module for Google Cloud Pub/Sub and the Wazuh module for Google Cloud Storage to monitor and secure your Google Cloud environment. These modules integrate with the :doc:`Google Cloud Pub/Sub </cloud-security/gcp/supported-services/pubsub>` and :doc:`Google Cloud Storage buckets <>` services. Using the Wazuh module for Google Cloud Pub/Sub, for example, you can collect and analyze log data from various Google Cloud services, such as Compute Engine, Cloud Firewall, VPC Flow Logs, and more.
