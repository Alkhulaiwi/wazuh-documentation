The integration with |service| can be configured in the Wazuh manager (which also behaves as an agent) or directly in a Wazuh agent. This choice merely depends on how you decide to access your |service| infrastructure in your environment.

The Wazuh manager includes all dependencies installed, these steps are only necessary when configuring the integration in a Wazuh agent.
