Sign up for a trial
===================

Wazuh provides a 14-day free trial for you to create a cloud environment and explore the Wazuh Cloud service. 

Follow the next steps to create your trial environment.

Sign up
-------

To sign up for a free trial, all you need is an email address:

#. Go to our `Wazuh Cloud Console <https://console.cloud.wazuh.com/>`_ page.

#. Enter your email address and password.

Now you are ready to create your first :ref:`environment <cloud_glossary_environment>`.

Create environment
------------------

Follow these steps to quickly set up and run your environment:

#. From the `Wazuh Cloud Console <https://console.cloud.wazuh.com/>`_, click **Start your free trial**.

#. Configure your environment:

   #. Give your environment a name.

   #. Select the :ref:`region <cloud_glossary_region>` where your environment gets hosted. If you are not sure what to pick, select one that is the closest to your location since this typically reduces latency for indexing and search requests.

   #. Fill in the use case. This information helps us understand why our users are utilizing our service, allowing us to improve it accordingly.

   #. Select the desired settings. To simplify the process, we have prepared three predefined sets of settings called "profiles": *Small*, *Medium*, and *Large*. If none of these profiles meet your requirements, you can always click on *Custom* and configure your settings individually. To learn more about the settings and their functionality, see the :doc:`Settings </cloud-service/your-environment/settings>` section.
   
      .. note:: During the 14-day trial period, certain settings are limited. Then, after the first payment, all restrictions are unlocked. These limitations are more than enough to get an insight into Wazuh Cloud.

   #. Choose between monthly or annual payments. If you select the monthly option, you will be billed on a monthly basis, whereas the annual option entails a single payment per year.

#. Click on **Start your free trial** to build your environment. This process might take a moment.

Once the environment is ready, you can :ref:`access the Wazuh WUI <cloud_wui_access>`  and register the agents. 

If you have any questions about the Wazuh Cloud, see the :doc:`Cloud service FAQ </cloud-service/getting-started/starting-faq>`.
