Settings
========

Every cloud environment is configured based on specific settings. These settings determine the limitations and capabilities of a cloud environment, and consequently, its pricing.

We offer six available settings, including four basic settings and two advanced settings. The advanced settings are automatically calculated based on the basic settings but can be modified if desired.

To monitor the behavior of your environment and check if the configured values of the settings are being reached, see the :doc:`Monitor usage section </cloud-service/your-environment/monitor-environment-usage>`. This section allows you to assess the performance and utilization of your environment, providing valuable insights into its current state.

Below, we provide a detailed explanation of each setting.

Active agents
-------------

This setting defines the maximum number of active agents that the environment can support. Please note that while it is possible to register an unlimited number of agents, the number of active agents is limited by this setting.

If the maximum number of active agents is reached, the environment may start to malfunction, causing instability with agent connections. While the system can tolerate temporarily exceeding the limit of active agents, appropriate measures will be taken if the situation persists.

Indexed data
------------

The indexed data, previously known as hot storage, includes the data available on the Wazuh WUI which corresponds to the information indexed by Wazuh. This information becomes searchable and analyzable as soon as Wazuh ingests and indexes the events sent by the agents.

There are two settings that define the behavior of the indexed data:

- Indexed data time: It determines the maximum duration for which data remains indexed.

- Indexed data size: It defines the maximum size, in bytes, of the indexed data. This setting is equivalent to what was previously referred as a "tier". This is an advanced setting, and the interface provides a suggestion when selecting the *Indexed data time*.

Data remains indexed until either the indexed data time or the indexed data size is reached. In other words, once either of the settings' values is reached, data rotation will occur (removing the oldest data) until the settings' conditions are met.

Archived data
-------------

This setting, previously known as cold storage, determines the duration for which the data generated by Wazuh is stored in an AWS S3 bucket for long-term storage purposes. Unlike the indexed data, this data is not searchable or analyzable. It simply consists of a collection of compressed files.

When the specified time is reached, data outside that time range will be deleted.

Support type
------------

This setting indicates whether the support level is premium or standard.

Data ingestion rate
-------------------

It represents the maximum number of events per second (EPS) that the environment can accept. This is an advanced setting, and the interface provides a suggestion when selecting the Active agents setting.

If the EPS limit is exceeded, events will start to be queued. However, if the queue becomes full, the incoming events will be discarded, which may lead to potential event loss. The queuing mechanism is automatically managed by the cloud service, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

The environment will be configured with the `limits eps option <https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/reference/ossec-conf/global.html#limits>`_  using the following parameters:

- timeframe = 10
- maximum = EPS setting / number of manager nodes

The number of manager nodes is automatically determined by the cloud service based on the workload, with a minimum of two nodes. For instance, if the EPS setting is 900 EPS, and there is a cluster of 2 nodes at the current time, each node will be able to process up to 450 events every 10 seconds.
