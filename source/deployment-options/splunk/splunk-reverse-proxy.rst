   :description: Learn how to place Splunk web behind a proxy with an NGINX setup in this section of the documentation.

Set up reverse proxy configuration for Splunk
=============================================

According to the Splunk official documentation, Splunk web can be placed behind a proxy in a reverse proxy type of configuration. In this section, we will describe how this can be done with an NGINX setup.

NGINX is a popular open-source web server and reverse proxy known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration and low resource consumption.

In this example, we will use it as a reverse proxy to provide encrypted and authenticated access to Splunk to end users.

.. note::

   The default port for the Splunk web interface is 8000. This tutorial will make the 80 and 443 ports available for HTTP/HTTPS access.

.. warning::

   The Splunk App Manager is not supported for use with a proxy server, if you use a proxy server with Splunk web, you must download and update apps manually.

NGINX SSL proxy for Splunk (RPM-based distributions)
----------------------------------------------------

#. Install NGINX:

   #. For CentOS:

       .. code-block:: console

          # cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo <<\EOF
          [nginx]
          name=nginx repo
          baseurl=http://nginx.org/packages/centos/$releasever/$basearch/
          gpgcheck=0
          enabled=1
          EOF

          # yum install nginx

   #. For RHEL:

      .. code-block:: console

         # cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo <<\EOF
         [nginx]
         name=nginx repo
         baseurl=http://nginx.org/packages/rhel/$releasever/$basearch/
         gpgcheck=0
         enabled=1
         EOF

         # yum install nginx

   .. note::
    
      For more information, see `NGINX: Official Red Hat/CentOS packages <https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/#official-red-hat-centos-packages>`_.

#. Install your SSL certificate and private key:

   #. If you have a valid **signed certificate**, copy your key file ``<ssl_key>`` and your certificate file ``<ssl_pem>`` to their proper locations:

      .. code-block:: console

         # mkdir -p /etc/pki/tls/certs /etc/pki/tls/private
         # cp <ssl_pem> /etc/pki/tls/certs/splunk-access.pem
         # cp <ssl_key> /etc/pki/tls/private/splunk-access.key

   #. If you do not have a valid **signed certificate**, create a **self-signed certificate** as follows. Remember to set the ``Common Name`` field to your server name. For instance, if your server is ``example.com``, you would do the following:

      .. code-block:: console

         # mkdir -p /etc/pki/tls/certs /etc/pki/tls/private
         # openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/splunk-access.key -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/splunk-access.pem

      .. code-block:: none
         :class: output

         Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
         ...........+++
         ................+++
         writing new private key to '/etc/pki/tls/private/splunk-access.key'
         -----
         You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
         into your certificate request.
         What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
         There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
         For some fields there will be a default value,
         If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
         -----
         Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]: US
         State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]: California
         Locality Name (eg, city) []: San Jose
         Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]: Example Inc.
         Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []: section
         Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []: example.com
         Email Address []: example@mail.com

#. Configure NGINX as an HTTPS reverse proxy to Splunk:

   .. code-block:: console

      # cat > /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf <<\EOF
      server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
      }

      server {
        listen 443 default_server;
        listen            [::]:443;
        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate /etc/pki/tls/certs/splunk-access.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/pki/tls/private/splunk-access.key;
        access_log            /var/log/nginx/nginx.access.log;
        error_log            /var/log/nginx/nginx.error.log;
        location / {
            auth_basic "Restricted";
            auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/conf.d/splunk.htpasswd;
            proxy_pass http://splunk-server-ip:8000/;
        }
      }
      EOF

#. Allow NGINX to connect to the Splunk port if SELinux is being used:

   .. code-block:: console

      # semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8000

   .. note::

      -  If you get the error message: ValueError: Port tcp/8000 already defined that mans another service has requested permissions for NGINX. Run the following command to modify the permissions:
         # semanage port -m -t http_port_t -p tcp 8000
      -  This assumes that you have ``policycoreutils-python`` installed to manage SELinux. Also, we assume that the port used for Splunk is the default one.

Enable authentication by htpasswd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Install the package ``httpd-tools``:

   .. code-block:: console

      # yum install httpd-tools

#. Generate the ``.htpasswd`` file. Make sure to replace ``wazuh`` with your chosen username, matching with the `auth_basic_user_file`:

   .. code-block:: console

      # htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/conf.d/splunk.htpasswd wazuh

#. Restart NGINX:

   .. include:: /_templates/common/restart_nginx.rst

Now, access the Splunk web interface via HTTPS. It will prompt you for the username and password that you created in the steps above.

NGINX SSL proxy for Splunk (Debian-based distributions)
-------------------------------------------------------

#. Install NGINX:

   .. code-block:: console

      # apt-get install nginx

#. Install your SSL certificate and private key:

   #. If you have a valid **signed certificate**, copy your key file ``<ssl_key>`` and your certificate file ``<ssl_pem>`` to their proper locations:

      .. code-block:: console

         # mkdir -p /etc/ssl/certs /etc/ssl/private
         # cp <ssl_pem> /etc/ssl/certs/splunk-access.pem
         # cp <ssl_key> /etc/ssl/private/splunk-access.key

   #. If you do not have a valid signed certificate, create a self-signed certificate as follows. Remember to set the ``Common Name`` field to your server name. For instance, if your server is ``example.com``, you would do the following:

      .. code-block:: console

         # mkdir -p /etc/ssl/certs /etc/ssl/private
         # openssl req -x509 -batch -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/splunk-access.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/splunk-access.pem

#. Configure NGINX as an HTTPS reverse proxy to Splunk:

   .. code-block:: console

      # cat > /etc/nginx/sites-available/default <<\EOF
      server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
      }

      server {
        listen 443 default_server;
        listen            [::]:443;
        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/splunk-access.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/splunk-access.key;
        access_log            /var/log/nginx/nginx.access.log;
        error_log            /var/log/nginx/nginx.error.log;
        location / {
            auth_basic "Restricted";
            auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/conf.d/splunk.htpasswd;
            proxy_pass http://splunk-server-ip:8000/;
        }
      }
      EOF

Enable authentication by htpasswd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Install the package ``apache2-utils``:

   .. code-block:: console

      # apt-get install apache2-utils

#. Generate the ``.htpasswd`` file replacing ``<user>`` below with your chosen username:

   .. code-block:: console

      # htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/conf.d/splunk.htpasswd <user>

#. Restart NGINX:

   .. include:: /_templates/common/restart_nginx.rst

Now, access the Splunk web interface via HTTPS. It will prompt you for the username and password that you created in the steps above.

.. warning::
  
   If you're facing permission issues or 502 code error, try executing this command: ``setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1``

Root endpoint
-------------

If you are hosting Splunk web behind a proxy that does not place it at the proxyâ€™s root, you may need to configure the root_endpoint setting in `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/web.conf`, navigate to the file and edit it.

For example, if your proxy hosts Splunk web at ``yourhost.com:8000/splunk``, you have to set up the ``root_endpoint`` option like this:

   .. code-block:: none

      [settings]
      root_endpoint=/splunk
