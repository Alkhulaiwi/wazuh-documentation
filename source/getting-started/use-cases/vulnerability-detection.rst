Vulnerability detection
=======================

Software vulnerabilities are weaknesses in code that can allow attackers to gain access to or manipulate the behavior of an application. Vulnerable software applications are commonly targeted by attackers to compromise endpoints and gain a persistent presence on targeted networks.

Vulnerability detection is the process of identifying these flaws before they are discovered and exploited by attackers. The goal of vulnerability detection is to identify vulnerabilities so that remediation can be carried out to prevent successful attacks.

The :doc:`Wazuh agent </getting-started/components/wazuh-agent>` collects the software inventory data from a monitored endpoint periodically and sends it to the Wazuh server. The Wazuh :doc:`Vulnerability Detector </user-manual/capabilities/vulnerability-detection/index>` module correlates the software inventory data with vulnerability feeds to detect vulnerable software on a monitored endpoint. Wazuh identifies vulnerable applications and produces risk reports using the information collected from the different operating system vendors and vulnerability databases. The :doc:`Vulnerability Detector </user-manual/capabilities/vulnerability-detection/how-it-works>` module uses a database of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) created automatically by processing data pulled from several sources including Wazuh feeds.

This variety of sources ensures that the Vulnerability Detector module provides coverage for a variety of operating systems and applications. The module supports Windows, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, Amazon Linux, Arch Linux, and macOS operating systems.

Achieve comprehensive visibility
--------------------------------

The Vulnerability Detector module scans and generates alerts for vulnerabilities discovered on the operating system and applications installed on the monitored endpoint. It correlates the software inventory collected by the Wazuh agent with the vulnerability database and displays the alert generated on the Wazuh dashboard. This provides a clear and comprehensive view of vulnerabilities identified in all monitored endpoints, allowing you to view, analyze and fix vulnerabilities.

On the Wazuh dashboard, the vulnerabilities discovered are grouped into severity levels and a summary is provided based on the application name, CVE, and CVSS3 score. This allows analysts to direct their focus appropriately.

The Vulnerability Detector module is configured to run scans at intervals. We can view the alerts generated on the dashboard when new vulnerabilities are discovered.

The alerts generated on the dashboard could also be a result of remediation activities. The image below shows alerts generated after an upgrade or an uninstallation of a package resolved a vulnerability.

Obtain actionable intelligence from vulnerability alerts
--------------------------------------------------------

Wazuh vulnerability alerts contain relevant information about the identified vulnerability which can help users understand and decide on remediation steps. You can see an example of a vulnerability detection alert below:

As you can see above, the alert contains key information about the detected vulnerability. This information includes the CVE information, reference links for further research, and a title that provides a concise description of the vulnerability.

Track vulnerability remediation
-------------------------------

The Wazuh Vulnerability Detector module also allows you to confirm when a vulnerability has been remediated. This feature detects when a patch or software upgrade resolves a previously detected vulnerability. The feature is enabled using the :ref:`hotfixes <wodle_syscollector_hotfixes>` option and is available for Windows endpoints.

Use vulnerability reports to identify critical security issues
--------------------------------------------------------------

Wazuh provides users with the ability to download a report that contains security events related to discovered and resolved vulnerabilities. This feature allows users to identify endpoints with unresolved vulnerabilities and keep track of remediation activities.
